# Setting up ElasticSearch

Elasticsearch is a platform for distributed search and analysis of data in real time. It is a popular choice due to its usability, powerful features, and scalability.

Here I'm gonna show U the steps I use for biulding muy own instance.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elastic.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install elasticsearch -y
```
During the installation read the **output**. It contains a password for your user!
